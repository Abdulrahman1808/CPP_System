## Technical Architecture

### File Structure

```
cpp_test/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.cpp              # Application entry point
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MainWindow.h/cpp      # Main application window
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DashboardScreen.h/cpp # Dashboard interface
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SalesScreen.h/cpp     # Sales processing
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ InventoryScreen.h/cpp # Inventory management

```

### Key Components

- **MainWindow**: Central application container with navigation
- **DashboardScreen**: Overview and quick actions
- **SalesScreen**: Transaction processing with cart management
- **InventoryScreen**: Product management with CRUD operations
- **ReportsScreen**: Analytics and reporting interface

### Data Management

- **No Static Data**: All data is user-generated
- **In-Memory Storage**: Data persists during application session
- **Real-time Updates**: All screens update based on user actions
- **Validation**: Input validation and error handling throughout

## Customization

### Adding New Features

1. **New Screens**: Create new .h/.cpp files following existing patterns
2. **Database Integration**: Replace in-memory storage with database calls
3. **Additional Reports**: Extend ReportsScreen with new report types
4. **Payment Methods**: Add new payment options in SalesScreen

### Styling

The application uses a dark theme with:

- Background: #282c34
- Cards: #2d313a
- Accent colors: Green (#4CAF50), Blue (#2196F3), Orange (#FF9800), Red (#F44336)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Qt Not Found**: Ensure Qt is properly installed and in PATH
2. **Build Errors**: Check C++17 support and Qt version compatibility
3. **No Products**: Add products through Inventory before using Sales
4. **Empty Reports**: Generate data through sales/inventory before viewing reports

### Development Notes

- **Cross-platform**: Designed for Windows but can be adapted for Linux/macOS
- **Scalable**: Architecture supports adding database, networking, and additional features
- **Modular**: Each screen is independent and can be enhanced separately

## Future Enhancements

- **Database Integration**: SQLite or MySQL for persistent storage
- **User Authentication**: Login system with role-based access
- **Receipt Printing**: Thermal printer support
- **Barcode Scanning**: Product scanning capabilities
- **Multi-language**: Internationalization support
